title:  "Extempore docs update (Summer 2017 edition)"
author: Ben Swift

It's that time of year again---when teaching is over for the semester and I futz
about with Extempore infrastructure, tooling and documentation. Surely *this
time* I'll get it all completely right, and 2018 will be the year of <del>Linux
on the desktop</del> Extempore.

However, these are exciting times. There's a [new lurk
channel](https://talk.lurk.org/), others are getting involved with the
documentation process (join the `#extempore-docs` channel), and there are some
cool language features in the pipeline (they work, but they're not fast yet).

If you'd like to help out with any of the above, or if you just want to show us
something cool you made, then let us know on the [mailing
list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).
