## Aggregate Types

Sometimes you need to store multiple pieces of data in a single variable. Extempore has four types for this:

+ Arrays
+ Vectors
+ Tuples
+ Abstract Data Types

### Arrays

![image](/images/array-examples.png)

An array in xtlang is a **fixed length** array of elements of a single type (like a
static C array). The array type signature specifies the length of the array, the
type of the array elements, and is closed off with the pipe (`|`) character. For Example:

+ `|4,double|*`: a pointer to an array of 4 `double`
+ `|10000000,i32|*`: a pointer to an array of one million `i32`
+ `|3,<double,|15,float*|*>*|**`: a pointer to a pointer to an array of pointers to 2-tuples, the second element of which is a pointer to an array of 15 float pointers. Whew!

Notice that all of these are pointers to arrays. When passing arrays around in Extempore we will always be passing a pointer to the array, rather than the array itself.

If we need to access the values in an array we can use `aref`. `aref` takes two arguments:

1. A pointer to the array
1. An integer index into the array (of type `i64`) where the index starts at 0.

If you try to reference an element that lies outside the array then the compiler will complain and your code won't compile.

So for example given the array `a:|4,double|*` we can access it in serial order like this:

+ `(aref a 0)`
+ `(aref a 1)`
+ `(aref a 2)`
+ `(aref a 3)`

or use it in a function like this:

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func get-member2
  (lambda (v:|4,i64|*)
    (aref v 2)))
~~~~

But `(aref a 4)` won't compile as `a` only has 4 elements.

You can also get the memory location of a member array using `aref-ptr`:

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func get-member2:[i64*,|4,i64|*]*
  (lambda (v:|4,i64|*)
    (aref-ptr v 2)))
~~~~

We can set values using `aset!`. `aset!` takes three arguments:

1. A pointer to the array.
1. An integer index into the array (of type `i64`) where the index starts at 0.
1. The new value for that index.

So for example given the array `a:|4,double|*` we can set each value to 0 like this:

+ `(aset! a 0 0)`
+ `(aset! a 1 0)`
+ `(aset! a 2 0)`
+ `(aset! a 3 0)`

and we can use it in a function like this:

~~~~ sourceCode
;; Set every member of the array to 0
(bind-func zero-set
  (lambda (v:|4,i64|*)
    (let ((i 0))
      (dotimes (i 4)
        (aset! v i 0)))))
~~~~

We could also do the same thing more succinctly using `afill!`:

+ `(afill! a 0 0 0 0) ;; set each value to 0`
+ `(afill! a 1 2 3 4) ;; Set a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2, a[2] = 3, a[3] = 4`

and redefining the function above we get this:

~~~~ sourceCode
;; Set every member of the array to 0
(bind-func zero-set
  (lambda (v:|4,i64|*)
    (afill! v 0 0 0 0)))
~~~~

You can also initialize arrays directly using array_ref:

~~~~ sourceCode
;; Initialize and create an array
(bind-func test-array
  (lambda ()
    (let ((arr:|4,i64|* (array_ref 1 2 3 4)))
      (zero-set arr))))  ;; TODO should probably change this to print out to cmd line.
~~~~

### Vectors

A second aggregate data type in XTLang is the vector type. These are almost identical to arrays, but operations on vector types use the CPUs CIMD registers and instructions (assuming your hardware has them). For certain types of processing this can result in significant performance speedups, but Vectors are less flexible than arrays as they do not support conditionals and branching.

The syntax for vector types looks just like the array syntax, except the pipes (|) are replaced with slashes (/), presumably because they’re going faster:

+ `/4,float/*` - a pointer to a vector of four floats
+ `/256,i32/*` - a pointer to a vector of 256 ints

The functions for working with vectors are also very familiar: `vfill!`, `vset!` and `vref`

Unless you know that the particular code you’re working on is the performance bottleneck in your system, it’s probably best to start out with arrays, and to change to vectors later on if it becomes necessary.

### Tuples

A tuple is a fixed-length type also, but the elements of a tuple can be different types. The syntax for declaring a tuple in xtlang is `<>`. Like arrays and vectors, a tuple is always a pointer type:

+ `<double,i32>*` - a pointer to a 2-tuple: the first element is a double and the second element is an i32
+ `<i64*,i64,float**>*` - a pointer to a 3 tuple: the first element is a pointer to an i64, the second is an i64, and the third is a pointer to a pointer to a float
+ `<double,[i32,i32]*>` - a pointer to a 2 tupe: the first element is a double, the second element is a closure of type `[i32,i32]*`.
+ `<i32,|4,i32|*>` - a pointer to a 2 tupe: the first element is an i32, the second element is a an array of 4 `i32`s.

The functions for working with tuples are: `tref`, `tset!` and `tfill!`. These work identically to the functions `aref`, `aset!` and `afill!`. So given the tuple `tup:<double,float,i64>*`

+ `(tref tup 0)` - will return the `double` value.
+ `(tset! tup 1 3.2)` - will set the `float` value of `tup` to `3.2`
+ `(tfill! tup 3.2 5.6 5)` - will set the first element to `3.2:double`, the second element to `5.6:float`, the third element to `5:i64`.

And finally, if you want a reference to (rather than the value of) an element in the tuple, use tref-ptr instead of tref:

+ `(tref-ptr tup 1)` - will give you the memory location of the float value.

## Custom Types {#named-types}

To round it off, you can also define your own types. This is convenient: it's
easier to type `my_type` than `[double*,<i64,i32>,float,float]`, especially if
it's a type that you'll be using a lot in your code.

There are two ways to define a custom type: `bind-type` and `bind-alias`.

Examples:

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-alias my_type_1 <i64,double>)
(bind-type my_type_2 <float,[i64,i32]*,|3,double|*>)
~~~~

`bind-type` tells the xtlang compiler about your new type, which provides some
safety benefits: the more the compiler knows about the types in your code, the
more errors it can throw at compile time and save messy runtime errors and
tricky debugging.

As an example, let's make a 2D 'point' type, and a function for calculating the
euclidean distance between two points.

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-type point <double,double>)

(bind-func euclid_distance
  (lambda (a:point* b:point*)
    (sqrt (+ (pow (- (tref a 0)
                   (tref b 0))
                2.0)
             (pow (- (tref a 1)
                     (tref b 1))
                  2.0)))))
~~~~

To test this out, we can check the diagonal length of the unit square, which
should be `sqrt(2) = 1.41`

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func test_unit_square_diagonal
  (lambda ()
    (let ((bot_left:point* (alloc))
          (top_right:point* (alloc)))
      (tfill! bot_left 0.0 0.0)
      (tfill! top_right 1.0 1.0)
      (printf "The length of the unit square's diagonal is %f\n"
              (euclid_distance bot_left
                               top_right)))))

(test_unit_square_diagonal)

;; prints "The length of the unit square's diagonal is 1.414214"
~~~~

Now, what happens if we change this testing example to make `top_right` and
`bot_left` just plain tuples of type `<double,double>` instead of being our new
`point` type.

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func test_unit_square_diagonal_2
  (lambda ()
    (let ((bot_left:<double,double>* (alloc))
          (top_right:<double,double>* (alloc)))
      (tfill! bot_left 0.0 0.0)
      (tfill! top_right 1.0 1.0)
      (printf "The length of the unit square's diagonal is %f\n"
              (euclid_distance bot_left
                               top_right)))))
~~~~

Now, instead of compiling nicely, we get the compiler error:

~~~~ sourceCode
Compiler Error: Type Error: (euclid_distance bot_left top_right)
 function argument does not match. Expected "%point*" but got "{double,double}*"
~~~~

Even though `point` *is* just a `<double,double>` (check the `bind-type`
definition above), the compiler won't let us compile the function. This is a
good thing most of the time, because it makes us be more explicit about what we
actually mean in our code, and saves us from the silly mistakes that can happen
when we're not clear about what we want.

There are lots of possibilities for the use of custom types, and there's no
problem with binding as many as you need to make your code and intention
clearer. Binding custom types could, for instance, allow for the construction of
a 'data structures' library like the C++ STL containers library or the Java
collections framework.

`bind-alias`, in contrast to `bind-type`, is just a simple alias for the given
type. The xtlang compiler, when it sees `my_alias` in the code, will simply
substitute in the appropriate type (in this case `<i64,|3,double|*>*`) before it
generates the LLVM IR to send to the compiler. `bind-alias` doesn't tell the
compiler as much about the code as `bind-type` does, which can lead to
execution-time problems which would otherwise have been caught by the compiler.
So you should almost always use `bind-type` over `bind-alias`.

## Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

{:.note-box}
While Algebraic Data Types work, they are currently slow to compile and have bad error messages. This is something that is being worked on, but in the meantime be warned...
{:.note-box}

Imagine that you have a shape type that can either be a circle, or a square: In Extempore we could create a type for this as follows:

~~~~ sourceCode
;; load the adt library
(sys:load "libs/base/adt.xtm")

(bind-type point <double,double>)

(bind-data Shape
           (Circle point double)
           (Rect point point))
~~~~

Note that ADTs are not part of the core library so you have to load the ADT library first.

Now that we've defined this ADT what can we do with it. Lets create a simple function that returns a circle:

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func make-shape:[Shape*,point,double]*
  (lambda (pos:point rad:double)
    (Circle pos rad)))
~~~~

There are two things to note here:

1. We can create a circle by calling a function that has the same name as the Shape type that we want. This function takes as parameters the values associated with `Circle` (there is a similar function called `Rect`.
1. Although we created a `Circle` this value has the type: `Shape`. The only way that we can create a `Shape` is by calling the functions `Circle`, or `Rect`.

Now that we have a `Shape` type, how do we use it? Let's create a function that prints a shape:

~~~~ sourceCode
(bind-func print-shape
  (lambda (shape:Shape*)
    (Circle$ shape (pos rad) 
             (println "x: %f, y: %f, Radius: %f" (tref pos 0) (tref pos 1) rad)
             (Rect$ shape (point1 point2)
                    (println "x1: %f, y1: %f\nx2: %f, y2: %f" 
                             (tref point1 0) (tref point1 1)
                             (tref point2 0) (tref point2 1))
                    void))))
~~~~

The important functions here are `Circle$` and `Rect$`. So where did they come from? When you create a new ADT with `bind-data` the xtlang compiler creates a macro for each sub-type that allows you to access the data. The macro name is the name of the sub-type followed by the '$' sign. So for the Shape type we have the macros: `Circle$` and `Rect$`. 

So let's examine the `Circle$` macro more closely. This takes four arguments:

1. A variable of type `Shape`.
1. Two variables inside brackets: `pos` and `rad`. These variables are the two member variables for the `Rect` sub-type in the same order that are declared in the `bind-data` declaration above. 
  1. `pos` has type `point`.
  1. `rad` has type `double`.
1. A form of type `[!a]*`. Where `!a` just means that this function can return any type.
  1. This form has the variables `point` and `rad` declared as part of its lexical scope.
1. A second form of type `[!a]`. Where `!a` means that this function must return the same type as the previous form. This form *does not* have access to the variables `point` and `rad`.

Let's consider what happens when shape = `(Circle (point 3.0 4.0) 2.0)`. `pos` is given the value `(point 3.0 4.0)` and `rad` is given the value `2.0`. These values are set as part of the lexical scope of the first form which is then called. The second form is ignored.

Now let's consider the other scenario when shape = `(Rect (point 3.0 4.0) (point 4.0 5.0))`. The second form is called, everything else is ignored.

So `Circle$` and `Rect$` give us a way to write code that can respond differently according to which of the sub-types are passed in, and to access their data. Note that when calling `Circle$` we don't have to handle the situation where `Shape` is a `Rect`, all we have to do is to provide a default for when `Shape` is *not* a circle. If we want to handle *all* the sub-types of `Shape` then we need to use `Rect$` as our default in `Circle$`. And this is exactly what we did for `print-shape` above.

This concludes our tour of the different types available to us in xtlang. Don't worry at this stage if you don't understand everything. In later chapters we will build upon what we've discussed in this chapter and this will develop your intuition for how these work.

## Conclusion

In this chapter we've given you a whirlwind tour of the different types available in xtlang and how they are used. In the next chapter we will look some more at user defined types and some of the ways in which you can use them. If you're still a little fuzzy on some of this stuff, the next chapter should help with that.
