title: The shared system
hidden: true
---

Conceptually, the Extempore shared system is a few things:

- an easy-to-set-up signal chain with three configurable analogue synth
  instruments (including the ability to load & store presets)

- a pattern language (a
  pseudo-[DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) for
  specifying repeating patterns and musical transformations (beats & loops)

- a MIDI setup (both in & out) for working with other software instruments &
  hardware controllers

## Getting started

- if you want to dive into playing & configuring the analogue synth stuff first,
  then start with `examples/sharedsystem/analogue_synth_basics.xtm`

- if you want to dive into making loops & beats with the pattern language first,
  then start with `examples/sharedsystem/pattern_basics.xtm` (perhaps moving on
  to `examples/sharedsystem/drum_synth_basics.xtm` afterwards)

The "shared system" name is inspired by the [**Make Noise** _Shared
System_](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/black-and-gold-shared-system-plus)
series of modular synths. It's
[Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack)-based, so _in principle_ it
could have any/all sorts of different components, but they've chosen a standard
set of modules so that people can share tips/patches/ideas directly because
they're using the _same_ configurable set of modules. In the same way, the
Extempore shared system is an "curated" take on Extempore's audio/music making
workflow. Obviously if it's not to your taste then you've still got the full
power of Extempore under the hood; but if you just want to fire it up and get
people dancing then this is a good way forward üòÅ
