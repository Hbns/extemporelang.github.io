title: The shared system

{:.info-box}

The "shared system" name is inspired by the [**Make Noise** _Shared
System_](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/black-and-gold-shared-system-plus)
series of modular synths. It's
[Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack)-based, so _in principle_ it
could have any/all sorts of different components, but they've chosen a standard
set of modules so that people can share tips/patches/ideas directly because
they're using the _same_ configurable set of modules. In the same way, the
Extempore shared system is an "curated" take on Extempore's audio/music making
workflow. Obviously if it's not to your taste then you've still got the full
power of Extempore under the hood; but if you just want to fire it up and get
people dancing then this is a good way forward üòÅ
